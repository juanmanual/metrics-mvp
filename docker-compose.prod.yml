#
# Serves the compiled frontend assets from nginx at http://localhost:8080 ,
# which proxies paths starting with /api to the flask backend.
#
# This allows running locally with the same configuration as used
# in kubernetes.
#
# The production flask service does not support hot reloading, so it
# needs to be restarted to reflect any python code changes.
#
# The web container needs to be rebuilt via
# `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build web`
# to reflect any frontend code changes.
